Beri Clinic faces challenges in managing patient records and appointments due to its reliance on manual processes. The current paper-based system is inefficient, prone to errors, and time-consuming. This leads to difficulties in tracking patient history, scheduling appointments, and managing medical records. Additionally, the lack of a centralized database makes it difficult to analyze patient data and identify trends.

- The initial phase involves designing and constructing the database schema. This entails creating individual tables to store various types of data, such as patient information, appointment details, and medical records. Each table is carefully defined with appropriate data types and constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency. Constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique indexes, are applied to enforce relationships between tables and prevent invalid data from being entered.

- The next step involves  filling the patient table with relevant data. This includes entering the patient's name, phone number, date of birth, gender, and address. By capturing this information, we establish a comprehensive profile for each patient, providing essential details for their healthcare records.
